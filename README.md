# Plant-Disease-Detection-CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Python and TensorFlow to classify plant leaves as healthy or unhealthy. The trained model is deployed as a web application using Flask, allowing users to upload images of plant leaves and receive real-time health status predictions.
